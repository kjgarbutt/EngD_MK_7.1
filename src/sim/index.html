        "MK_7" is the seventh iteration of my EngD project model.
        The model imports a number of GIS shapefiles, creates multiple sets of agents, and moves those agents from A to B.

        <p>The simulation starts by reading and displaying GIS data describing the road network of Norfolk,
          the political boundaries, the area's flood zone and the Open Source Vulnerability Index (OS-VI).
          The simulation reads a .CSV file that includes road network data and demographic data and places agents on the road network
          at pre-assigned locations. These agents are also assigned destinations by the user (see: 'goals').
          When the simulation starts, the agents determine the shortest path (A*) to their destination and move towards their destinations.
          Once they arrive, the agents wait for all other agents to arrive before they return to their start points.
          The cycle continues until ended by the user.
